This is the workspace for the ScalaUA 2019 talk, "Thinking Functionally."

Try your hand at taking a procedural service, and refactoring to its functional equivalent.

Along the way, you may find you accidentally fix some bugs, easily fix others, and end up making the code easier to understand and easier to safely change.

Congratulations, you've just discovered both the _how_ and _why_ of functional Scala!
